*   Â Inventory
    *   There is a system set up for custom objects (items).
    *   There is a collection system (inventory) set up for items.
    *   Through normal interaction with the program, it is possible to add items to and remove items from the inventory.
    *   Through normal interaction with the program, it is possible to interact with items through the inventory.
    *   Interacting with items in the inventory is treated differently from interacting with items outside the inventory.
*   Location
    *   There is a system set up for custom objects (locations).
    *   At any point in time, there is one particular location that is unique (player location).
    *   Through normal interaction with the game, it is possible to change the player location.
    *   Changing player location may be subject to conditions.
    *   There is at least one initially impossible player location change that becomes possible (or vice versa) through normal interaction with the game.
*   Non-player characters (NPCs)
    *   There is a system set up for custom objects (NPCs).
    *   NPCs exist independently from inventory and location.

    *   There is a (generic) setup that allows interaction with NPC objects to affect other objects.
*   Player classes
    *   There is a system set up for custom objects (classes).
    *   At any point in time, there is one particular class that is unique (player class).
    *   The player must be able to choose or influence the player class at some point in the game.
    *   The player class modulates interaction in the game.
    *   There is a single set of actions a player can perform some particular class that will complete the game, but which is not possible for some other class.
