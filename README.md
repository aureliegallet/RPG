# RPG Game
The instructions for this project can be found in [Instructions.md](Instructions.md).

I worked in a team of four people and was in charge of the Inventory part of the game. The guidelines for the inventory were as follows:

- The game should have an inventory system. This could represent a bag of items, a party of team members, conversation topics, or clues obtained in the game world.
- It should be possible to add and remove elements from the inventory system.
- The player should be able to interact with elements of the inventory system. For example, they should be able to inspect objects, rearrange team members, or combine clues.

More specifically, I worked on:
- Game Engine and Game View
- Player Items and Map Items
- Small Inventory View and Big Inventory View
- Shops and their Inventory
- Menu Bar
